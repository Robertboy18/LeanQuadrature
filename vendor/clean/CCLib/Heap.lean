  The heap resource algebra — Phase 7.2 of the separation-logic plan.

  A `Heap` is a *fragment* of a `Mem`: a partial map from (block, offset) to a
  permission and a byte.  Separating conjunction will be disjoint union of
  fragments, and `Agrees` is the erasure that connects a fragment back to a
  concrete CompCert memory.

  ## One permission per cell

  CompCert's `Mem.access` carries a `Cur` and a `Max` permission per byte, but
  every operation in `CCLib/Memory.lean` keeps them equal: `alloc` sets both,
  `uncheckedFree` zeroes both (its range branch ignores the `PermKind`),
  `store`/`storebytes` leave `access` untouched, and `dropPerm` sets both.  So
  `Cur = Max` is invariant for any program that does not call `dropPerm` mid-run —
  only `Genv.allocGlobals` does — and a cell can carry a single `Permission`.

  This is a *stated restriction*, not a theorem about CompCert: memories where
  `Cur < Max` are expressible in the model and are not described by any `Heap`.

  ## Unique ownership

  There are no fractional permissions: disjointness is disjointness of domains,
  so a byte has at most one owner.  For sequential code this is not a real
  limitation — a caller lends a buffer to a callee and gets it back in the
  postcondition — and it avoids needing a share algebra.

  ## Fragments do not describe all of memory

  `Agrees h m` constrains only the cells `h` owns.  Un-owned memory (other stack
  frames, globals nobody mentions) is simply not described.  That is what makes
  the frame rule fall out in Phase 7.4, and it means no leak-freedom is claimed.
