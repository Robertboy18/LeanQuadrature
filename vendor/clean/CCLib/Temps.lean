  **Local state as a tracked list of temporaries** (Phase-9 Step 10).

  ## The problem this solves

  In the early example proofs (`IsSortedSep`, `SwapSep`) the local state was a hand-written
  conjunction, one `le.get id = some v` per tracked temporary, so every `Sset`
  proof re-established each conjunct with its own `PTree.gso` and its own named
  disequality:

      exact ⟨he, (PTree.gso _ _ _ _ hd.adler_buf).trans hbuf,
             (PTree.gso _ _ _ _ hd.adler_len).trans hlen, PTree.gss _ _ _, …⟩

  That is `O(#tracked temps)` lines *per statement*, and the Step-0 calibration
  measured it as the bulk of a real zlib function proof — `adler32_z` alone has
  40 `_t'n` temporaries from `-normalize`.

  ## The fix

  Two changes, and the second is what makes the first cheap:

  1. Structure the state as `TempsHold : List (Ident × Val) → TempEnv → Prop`.
     One frame lemma (`TempsHold_set`) then re-establishes the *whole* list
     across a `PTree.set`, so a statement costs `O(1)` proof lines instead of
     `O(N)`.  Temporaries not yet assigned are simply absent from the list —
     which also removes the `Option`-slot case splits the old style needed.

  2. `identOfString` is kernel-reducible (see `CCLib.Positive`), so the frame
     lemma's side condition — `∀ p ∈ l, p.1 ≠ id`, a single goal over a concrete
     list — is discharged by plain `decide`.  Before that change it needed
     `native_decide`, which is why the old code carried hand-listed `Distinct`
     structures instead.

/-- `id = a;` — the whole `PTree.gso` chain collapses into `hne`.

    `l₀` is what the precondition tracks; `l` is `l₀` with `id`'s stale entry (if
    any) dropped, which `hsub` checks.  Both side conditions are one-liners over
    concrete lists: `hsub` by `simp`, `hne` by `decide`. -/

/-! ## Forward chaining: computing the post-state instead of supplying it

`triple_set_local` above makes the **caller** supply the pruned list `l` and
prove `hsub`/`hne` about it.  That is what makes a chain of assignments expensive:
a loop body with five assignments spent a third of its proof writing out
mid-condition lists, each repeating the invariant's entries, with two side
conditions apiece.

The fix is not a tactic but a definition.  If the pruned list is **computed** from
`l₀` and `id`, then `hsub` and `hne` stop being obligations and become theorems,
proved once here.  The tactic at the end of this section then just chains the
resulting rule and never mentions a list at all. -/

`triple_seq` wants the first statement's triple to carry the *outer* exit
conditions, but every forward rule above produces `.only`.  `triple_seq_fwd`
does that weakening, so a straight-line block is a chain of `triple_seq_fwd`
with no plumbing in between. -/

/-! ## Tactics

**Usage constraint:** a named tracked list must be an `abbrev`, not a `def`.
Both tactics below work on the list's *structure* (`simp`/`decide` over the
conses), so an irreducible name blocks them.  `examples/TempsCheck.lean` pins this. -/

/-- Discharges `∀ p ∈ l, p.1 ≠ id` for a concrete tracked list.

    `decide` cannot see the goal directly — the tracked *values* mention free
    variables and `decide` rejects goals with those — so `simp only
    [List.forall_mem_cons]` first splits the list into a closed conjunction of
    identifier disequalities, which one `decide` then settles.  That last step is
    kernel work only because `identOfString` was made reducible
    (`CCLib.Positive`); it used to need `native_decide` per pair. -/
macro "temps_ne" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| first
      | decide
      | (simp only [List.forall_mem_cons]; decide)
      | assumption)

/-- Discharges `(id, v) ∈ l` when reading a tracked temporary back out, and
    `∀ p ∈ l, p ∈ l₀` when dropping a stale entry.  Plain `simp`: the entries are
    syntactically identical, so no equality has to be *decided*. -/
macro "temps_mem" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| first
      | (intro _ hq; exact List.mem_cons_of_mem _ hq)
      | (simp; done)
      | simp
      | decide
      | assumption)

/-- **Chain a whole tree of assignments.**

    Walks `Ssequence`/`Sset` structure applying `triple_seq_fwd` and
    `triple_set_local_fwd`, and leaves exactly one goal per assignment: its `hev`
    obligation, which is the only part that is not bookkeeping.  Every
    mid-condition is *computed* by `setLocal`, so no tracked list appears in the
    proof text.

    It stops at any statement that is not a sequence or an assignment — an `if`, a
    call, a loop — leaving that `Triple` as a goal for the caller.  That is the
    intended behaviour, not a limitation: those are the steps that need thought.

    Terminates because each application strictly shrinks the statement, so
    `any_goals` eventually finds no `Triple` goal to make progress on. -/
macro "localst_fwd" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| repeat (any_goals (first
      | apply CC.Sep.triple_seq_fwd
      | apply CC.Sep.triple_set_local_fwd)))

/-- Reads a tracked temporary out of a `setLocal` chain.

    **Peels the chain structurally rather than `simp`ing the membership.**  That
    matters: `simp` turns `q ∈ setLocal …` into a disjunction of pairwise
    equalities and then cannot finish, because the tracked *values* contain free
    variables so `decide` rejects the whole goal.  `mem_setLocal_of_mem` splits the
    two halves — the identifier disequality goes to `decide` on its own, where it
    is closed, and the membership recurses. -/
macro "temps_get" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| repeat (first
      | exact CC.Sep.mem_setLocal_head _ _ _
      | refine CC.Sep.mem_setLocal_of_mem' ?_ (by decide)
